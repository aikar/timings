(See [below] for details.)\n* **ansiStream** – *(optional)* A stream that's been blessed by the [ansi]\n  module to include various commands for controlling the cursor in a terminal.\n\n[ansi]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ansi\n[below]: #theme-objects\n\nConstructs a new gauge. Gauges are drawn on a single line, and are not drawn\nif the current terminal isn't a tty.\n\nThe **options** object can have the following properties, all of which are\noptional:\n\n* maxUpdateFrequency: defaults to 50 msec, the gauge will not be drawn more\n  than once in this period of time. This applies to `show` and `pulse`\n  calls, but if you `hide` and then `show` the gauge it will draw it\n  regardless of time since last draw.\n* theme: defaults to Gauge.unicode` if the terminal supports\n  unicode according to [has-unicode], otherwise it defaults to `Gauge.ascii`.\n  Details on the [theme object](#theme-objects) are documented elsewhere.\n* template: see [documentation elsewhere](#template-objects) for\n  defaults and details.\n\n[has-unicode]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/has-unicode\n\nIf **ansiStream** isn't passed in, then one will be constructed from stderr\nwith `ansi(process.stderr)`.\n\n### `gauge.show([name, [completed]])`\n\n* **name** – *(optional)* The name of the current thing contributing to progress. Defaults to the last value used, or \"\".\n* **completed** – *(optional)* The portion completed as a value between 0 and 1. Defaults to the last value used, or 0.\n\nIf `process.stdout.isTTY` is false then this does nothing. If completed is 0\nand `gauge.pulse` has never been called, then similarly nothing will be printed.\n\nIf `maxUpdateFrequency` msec haven't passed since the last call to `show` or\n`pulse` then similarly, nothing will be printed.  (Actually, the update is\ndeferred until `maxUpdateFrequency` msec have passed and if nothing else has\nhappened, the gauge update will happen.)\n\n### `gauge.hide()`\n\nRemoves the gauge from the terminal.\n\n### `gauge.pulse([name])`\n\n* **name** – *(optional)* The specific thing that triggered this pulse\n\nSpins the spinner in the gauge to show output. If **name** is included then\nit will be combined with the last name passed to `gauge.show` using the\nsubsection property of the theme (typically a right facing arrow).\n\n### `gauge.disable()`\n\nHides the gauge and ignores further calls to `show` or `pulse`.\n\n### `gauge.enable()`\n\nShows the gauge and resumes updating when `show` or `pulse` is called.\n\n### Theme Objects\n\nThere are two theme objects available as a part of the module, `Gauge.unicode` and `Gauge.ascii`.\nTheme objects have the follow properties:\n\n| Property   | Unicode | ASCII |\n| ---------- | ------- | ----- |\n| startgroup | ╢       | \\|    |\n| endgroup   | ╟       | \\|    |\n| complete   | █       | #     |\n| incomplete | ░       | -     |\n| spinner    | ▀▐▄▌    | -\\\\\\|/ |\n| subsection | →       | ->    |\n\n*startgroup*, *endgroup* and *subsection* can be as many characters as you want.\n\n*complete* and *incomplete* should be a single character width each.\n\n*spinner* is a list of characters to use in turn when displaying an activity\nspinner.  The Gauge will spin as many characters as you give here.\n\n### Template Objects\n\nA template is an array of objects and strings that, after being evaluated,\nwill be turned into the gauge line.  The default template is:\n\n```javascript\n[\n    {type: \"name\", separated: true},\n    {type: \"spinner\", separated: true},\n    {type: \"startgroup\"},\n    {type: \"completionbar\"},\n    {type: \"endgroup\"},\n    \"\\n\"\n]\n```\n\nObjects must have a type and can optionally have the `separated` property. \nIf the `separated` property is included then, if a value for this item is\navailable it will be separated from other parts of the template by spaces.\n\n### Differences\n\nThe biggest difference between this module and the many other progress bar\nmodules on npm is that this one doesn't maintain mutable state.  That is,\nwhile the completion percentage is cached, it can't be incremented or\ndecremented, only replaced.  This substantially reduces the complexity of\nthe module.\n\nIf you have more than one thing going on that you want to track completion\nif, you may find the related [are-we-there-yet] helpful.  It's `change`\nevent can be wired up to the `show` method to get a more traditional\nprogress bar interface.\n\n[are-we-there-yet]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/are-we-there-yet\n",
